### Welcome to Hannah Freudenberger's Portfolio
I graduated from Westminster College in May 2021 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a Business Management Minor. This is my portfolio showing projects from my time as a student that I am proud of and believe display my tehcincal skills well.

### Projects 
### [AvalancheApp](https://github.com/hannahlf/AvalancheApp)
This is my Senior Capstone for Westminster College. This is an iOS application that brings key knowledge to backcountry skiers about the weather and slope angle. This project was built in React Native. 


### [Student Demographics](https://github.com/augValdez/StudentDemographics)
This is my final project for Databases that Augustine Valdez and I did. This was a demographics survey for the students of Westminster, where we took the students' answers from the survey we created and run different queries on their information. We used python and MySQLite. This final project gave us total freedom for our creativity, it was challenging working that closely with a partner as well as the creativity the project gave with having such a vague prompt.

### [Proof Portfolio](https://github.com/hannahlf/ProofPortfolio)
This is a final proof portfolio that I created in my Discrete Mathematics course. This portfolio consists of four questions that we had to prove using different techinques that we learned throughout the year. I am particularily proud of this assignment because I recieved a 100% on it and I feel it strongly reflects my math and technical writing skills.

### [To Do List](https://github.com/hannahlf/251todo)
This is a to do list that I created in shell script for my Computer Systems and Programming course. The user can add items to their list and remove them or mark them as completed. I am proud of this project because it is in a language that I was largely unfamiliar with prior to this course and I think this is a good display of my ability to learn new languages and produce quality work in new spaces.
